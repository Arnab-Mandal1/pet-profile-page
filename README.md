### **1. üí° Introduction & Vision**

The goal of this project is to create a delightful, single-page web application to showcase a pet's profile. The page
will serve as a digital "about me" for a pet, featuring photos, key information, and fun personality quirks. The final
product should be visually appealing, shareable, and provide a heartwarming experience for visitors.

### **5. üé® Design & UX Requirements**

* **Look & Feel:** The design should be **warm, playful, and modern**. Use a cheerful color palette and soft, rounded
  corners.
* **Layout:** A single-page, vertically scrolling experience.
* **Responsiveness:** The application must be **mobile-first** üì± and fully responsive, providing an optimal viewing
  experience across all devices (mobile, tablet, desktop).
* **Typography:** Use a highly readable and friendly font combination. A sans-serif font like 'Nunito' or 'Poppins' is
  recommended.
* **Accessibility (A11y):**
    * Ensure proper color contrast ratios for text and backgrounds.
    * Use semantic HTML tags (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, etc.).
    * All images must have descriptive `alt` text for screen readers.

### **6. üíª Technical Specifications**

* **Frontend Framework:** **React.js**
* **Styling:** **Tailwind CSS** or a CSS-in-JS library like **Styled Components** for efficient and responsive styling.
* **Data Management:** For V1, all pet data (text, image URLs) will be stored locally in a `JSON` file or JavaScript
  object within the React application. No backend database is required.
* **Deployment:** The application will be deployed as a static site on a platform like **Vercel**, **Netlify**, or *
  *GitHub Pages**.

---

### **7. üìå Assumptions & Constraints**

* **Assumption:** The application is for a **single pet**. There is no functionality for creating multiple profiles.
* **Constraint:** This is a **read-only** application. There will be no admin panel or user-facing interface to edit the
  pet's details. All changes must be made directly in the source code.
* **Constraint:** The scope is limited to the features listed above. No additional features will be included in this
  version.

---

### **8. üî≠ Future Scope (Out of Scope for V1)**

* **User Accounts & Profiles:** A backend system allowing users to sign up and create/edit their own pet profiles via a
  web form.
* **Video Support:** The ability to add video clips üé• to the gallery.
* **Multiple Pets:** Functionality for a single user to create and manage profiles for multiple pets.
* **Themes:** Allow users to select different color schemes or layout themes for their pet's page.

üó∫Ô∏è Sitemap
Since this is a single-page application, the sitemap represents the different scrollable sections on the main page
rather than separate pages.

#hero - The main header section with the pet's name and primary photo.

#about - The section with key details like breed and age.

#gallery - The photo gallery section.
